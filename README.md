# ark_smart_feeder
Just a smart auto feeder for raising baby dinos in ark

I'm learning the python program flow as I'm doing this, so I'm just making things work. This is my first python GUI. I only spent a few hours rapidly prototyping this.

I'm making this for my tribe on Ark Survival Evolved so that way we can feed our giga babies while AFK

This is my first ever attempt at a python GUI. I wrote all the current code in a day. It's not commented as I was in a hurry. Building a user interface in Python sucks compared 
to .net in case anyone was wondering :)

Instructions:
1. Unzip
2. Run .exe
3. Set the settings first, discord id is found by enabling developer mode in settings->appearance on discord then right clicking your name on the right side of discord and copying id
4. create a webhook in a channel and paste the link to the webhook into the url field in settings. (Google how to make a webhook in discord if ya don't know how, its easy)
5. You'll have to play with settings for times. 90 mins, 5 min intervals, and 5 stacks works good for gigas but gonna depend on your rates. 
6. I doubt i'll make this any better, but I will fix stuff if someone likes it and gets use out of it
