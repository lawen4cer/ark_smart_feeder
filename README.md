# ark_smart_feeder
Just a smart auto feeder for raising baby dinos in ark

I'm learning the python program flow as I'm doing this, so I'm just making things work. This is my first python GUI.

I'm making this for my tribe on Ark Survival Evolved so that way we can feed our giga babies while AFK

This is my first ever attempt at a python GUI. I wrote all the current code in a day. It's not commented as I was in a hurry. Building a user interface in Python sucks compared 
to .net in case anyone was wondering :)
